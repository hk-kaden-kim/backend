        "Contents": "we should not legalize prostitution and we shouldn't legalize it because prostitution is inherently exploitative and it's also incredibly bad for women in the way that it uh renders women essentially as tools of male pleasure and thirdly because um by legalizing prostitution it's actually going to be more difficult to inform the um enforce against the worst aspects of prostitution because it'll be easier to conceal uh things like trafficking or underage prostitution things like that so let's first start by talking about why it's going to be inherently uh exploitative uh in the same way in that like uh certain kinds of jobs people don't take unless they're in like uh financially course of circumstances so like it's unlikely that people are going to want to take like more unsavory jobs um or like um things like that like people aren't going to want to take um like worse off jobs generally because um they're seen as like less desirable unless they need to for 1 reason or another or they're in like a more desperate situation so I think the problem with this is that it essentially means that like people's sexual autonomy is being stripped away from them and they're essentially um probably because of like financially coercive circumstances are being forced to surrender their sexual freedom and I think that's pretty messed up because that's like a pretty important thing to most people like your sexual Freedom your sexual identity um and your Independence is 1 of the most important things that you have and the fact that like um it can be stripped away and such that you're forced to employ a just to please men is probably not the best thing um but that brings me into the second reason why we should not legalize prostitution and that's that uh it legitimizes essentially the idea that uh women can just like pay for like men can just pay for women to uh sexually gratify them in such a way in which it essentially treats women like tools or like it treats women as if they don't have any kind of like real value or Agency on their own and they're just tools that exist for male pleasure and I think that that's probably bad for um both like women's rights but also for like uh normalizing amongst men the way in which women have autonomy women uh the way in which women have like uh rights and things like that while you're essentially just normalizing women being seen as like sexual objects for uh men that for pleasure the final thing that I want to talk about though is about how legalizing prostitution will make it harder to enforce against the worst kinds of prostitution and that's because once it becomes legal it's your uh not going to be able to just like arrest everybody you're not going to be able to like uh just investigate against every prostitution organization you may happen to come across now it's going to become a lot easier for people to like uh Forge documents that they need to to disguise themselves as legal prostitutes even if they are people who are like traffic or something like that so for all of those reasons do not legalize prostitution"
