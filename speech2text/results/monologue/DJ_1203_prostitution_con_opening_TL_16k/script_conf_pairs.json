        "Transcript": " so let's first start by talking about why it's going to be inherently uh exploitative uh in the same way in that like uh certain kinds of jobs people don't take unless they're in like uh financially course of circumstances so like it's unlikely that people are going to want to take like more unsavory jobs um or like um things like that like people aren't going to want to take um like worse off jobs generally because um they're seen as like less desirable unless they need to for 1 reason or another or they're in like a more desperate situation",

        "Transcript": " so I think the problem with this is that it essentially means that like people's sexual autonomy is being stripped away from them and they're essentially um probably because of like financially coercive circumstances are being forced to surrender their sexual freedom and I think that's pretty messed up because that's like a pretty important thing to most people like your sexual Freedom your sexual identity um and your Independence is 1 of the most important things that you have and the fact that like um it can be stripped away and such that you're forced to employ a just to please men is probably not the best thing",
