we absolutely should not ban gambling because it won't work first of all and secondarily there's nothing really wrong with gambling it should be fine it should be legal um if people want to do it so let's start by talking about why Banning gambling will not work at all so the point of banning something presumably is you want to deter people from doing it because you think it has some kind of harm or problem um so this has an assumption and the assumption is that the ban itself is actually going to deter people from the activity in the first place that is gambling so that's not going to happen and it's not going to happen because people have been gambling for thousands of years people rather enjoy gambling um it's a pretty ingrained part of our culture we have entire cities dedicated to it um you know like there's gambling in Las Vegas obviously I'm pretty sure there's a lot of gambling in places like a lot in Israel as well there's all kinds of um like a lot of cities please have these as their Industries and things like that so there's problems with this so first and foremost a problem is that you're going to see a whole whole lot of resistance from the people who are involved in a gambling industry a whole lot of resistance about the cities and livelihoods that are being destroyed and a whole lot of resistance to all of these kinds of policies and bands in the first place but second and more importantly it's completely unenforceable because you can just gamble on the internet um and there's nothing really the government can do the regulate it because often times the websites can be set up and like different countries or you can even if like the websites are under like any kind of certain set of laws you're there's always ways that you can use the internet to avoid government detection and I highly doubt that the government is going to dedicate like legit military and hacking and all kinds of Technical and physical and monetary resources to really cracking down gambling and if it wanted to do that it would cost like billions if not probably like like so much so many billions of dollars that it would be a complete waste of time since people are largely going to do it on the internet anyway and that's obviously a problem because first and foremost you're not making the money off of gambling anymore you can't tax gambling you can't um profit off of it so a lot of money and revenue is going away uh additionally when you ban something and it becomes a part of the black market it's more likely to be unsafe you're more likely going to have like crime Lords and people like that presiding over the factors uh and additionally you also can't have things like consumer uh protection laws in place uh so you can't really enforce things to make sure that like even obviously gambling is random and to a large extent and things like that but enforcement to make sure that like you aren't being as a gambler like completely screwed over by the people like the house per se so that's important as well um so gambling is probably going to happen anyway might as well happen safer more profitably and more effectively if you just regulate it rather than ban it but I also think that there's nothing wrong with gambling and it's rather immoral to abandon the first place because keep in mind that when people are gambling they're usually gambling with their own money if they're gambling with someone else's money we call them Wall Street Bankers so they're usually gambling with their own money not other people's so that's money that you've earned that's money that you can uh do what you want with you should have the right to spend your money on the way you want because you worked for it but additionally gambling doesn't harm anyone it's not like it gambling doesn't really harm people like any kind of vague things like crime or whatever that like maybe vaguely associated with gambling is problematic that's usually only because the other things like drugs or prostitution or whatever are illegal in the first place maybe that should be legal too but also keep in mind that like the black market argument that I made about how that's not going to be solved anyway so other than maybe like the vague facilitation of crime there's no real reason why gambling itself is all that bad why you shouldn't be able to spend your money um that you earned that way if you want to so for those reasons we should not ban gambling
