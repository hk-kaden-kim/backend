John:
we should not legalize prostitution we think that in the status quo there are a number of abuses that are associated with prostitution whether it's the fact that pimps and Johns are able to abuse prostitutes themselves whether it's the transmission of sexually transmitted disease through prostitution whether it's the fact that people are oftentimes coerced into entering the prostitution Market in the first place we think that legalizing prostitution is the wrong way to go about alleviating these abuses and furthermore we think that when you legalize prostitution you only entrench it as a business and make it more likely that those abuses will move forward so firstly we're going to talk about why those abuses are more likely to become prevalent in a legalized prostitution market and then we're going to talk about Alternatives if you actually care about alleviating those types of abuses so recognize that in the status quo women are often coerced into choosing or entering prostitution it's not a free choice this may be because their experiencing economic hardship it may be because they've been uh blocked out of the employment sphere because they may have a prior conviction that doesn't allow them to get employment or they may not have the education necessary to do so and therefore they enter prostitution furthermore John's and pimps can be massively abusive this can range from physical abuse being done against prostitutes to prostitutes being uh not being paid for their services we think that legalization is going to do a few things firstly it increases the incentive for people to enter the business and therefore just without any other changes to the structure of prostitution itself it's more likely to increase those harms as well we also think it makes it harder to punch for these abuses because when you legalize prostitution you make it harder for women to go against these people because there's already a stigma against those women it's more difficult for a woman to go against their to go to the police and say the person that I was being a pro the John that I had hurt me or didn't pay me or do these types of things because there's already a massive stigma against those people and now if they go forward and ask for some sort of relief they're only going to be viewed as having some sort of casualty of of the job that not being paid or being abused is part of the job of prostitution we think it's also unlikely to drive out illicit business so we think that in the status quo prostitution is obviously a mostly illicit business it's mostly done underground and I think that the structures that allow for that type of business to exist that black market to exist aren't undermined by the legalization of prostitution we think that there are different types of there are different levels to the prostitution Market that exists there are high class and there are street prostitutes and we don't think that legalization is going to alleviate the largely illicit street level Market that exists in the status quo because most people simply would not be able to access the higher-end market so what do we think is more likely to occur oh furthermore we think that you're only going to perpetuate the historical practice of objectifying women we think that while women are able to choose prostitution sometimes as I explained it's largely a coerced coercion based business a business isn't which women are coerced into entering and it only perpetuates the objectification of women and the use of women solely for their bodies we think this is a historical pattern that exists throughout western eastern all cultures and we don't think that legalization makes it any less likely that this is going to it makes it any more likely that this is going to stop and as such we think it's simply the case now when you legalize you continue to perpetuate these patriarchal ideas of objectification and of hypersexualization of women we think that a better Avenue would be to increase protections for prostitutes to create laws that punish John's and punish pimps but don't punish prostitutes because this ensures that the course of structures that uh Abused Women in the status quo are able to be legislated against they are able to be struck down rather than legalizing the market and making it easier for people to do these types of of abuses in broad daylight and increases the objectification of women which is already a problem in our modern society and for these reasons we should not legalize prostitution
