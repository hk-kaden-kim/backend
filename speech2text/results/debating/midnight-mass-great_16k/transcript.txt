KEANE:
I understand given your religious affiliation you might find the fact that your son is interested in the Bible offensive

HASSAN:
not at all

KEANE:
I suppose but I would say that if he is interested in Jesus why not allow him to learn

HASSAN:
a little about that's so not the issue and thank you for this opportunity to clarify uh he knows all about Jesus

KEANE:
well I imagine not quite all

HASSAN:
Muslims believe that Jesus is a prophet of God and that the angel of the Bible would reveal to him as the Torah was revealed to Moses before that see if we we love Jesus and we love the message that was revealed to him

KEANE:
well I suppose we learned something new every day don't we

HASSAN:
but we also believe after the time of Jesus thanks to the interference of men they were deviations in Christianity and people altered the message priests popes Kings that's why they're so so many versions of the Bible people got in there made their changes

KEANE:
I don't think this is relevant

HASSAN:
we do though believe that the Bible contains some of the original word of God

KEANE:
that's very generous

HASSAN:
of you but we also believe that God revealed the Quran as the final message never to be altered to reassert the original Revelations of the previous

KEANE:
I don't think that this is the place to discuss where our beliefs about scripture might divert

HASSAN:
exactly there it is that's the issue and that's why I think some of the people in this room including myself are a little concerned see Muslims encourage everyone to seek knowledge so I am more than comfortable with my son studying a Bible thrilled actually I've done it myself but where I think there's an issue is that this is a public school that's the thing and I think what's concerning some of us it's not the Bible itself but that it was handed out distributed to the kids here I just ask you to consider how you'd feel if you sent your child to a public school and they came home with a copy of the Quran asking about the Prophet Muhammad feel it was an issue if I went around handing out copies of the Quran to the children on this island purely in the interest of the pursuit of knowledge well I'd expect you chase me out of town this King

KEANE:
if I may
