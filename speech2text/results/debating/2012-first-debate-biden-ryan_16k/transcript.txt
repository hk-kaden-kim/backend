RADDATZ:
I would like to begin with Libya on a rather somber Note 1 month ago tonight on the anniversary of 911 Ambassador Chris Stevens and 3 other Brave Americans were killed in a terrorist attack in Benghazi the state department has now made clear there were no protesters there it was a pre-planned assault by heavily armed men wasn't this a massive intelligence failure Vice President Biden

BIDEN:
what it was was the tragedy Martha it uh Chris Stevens was 1 of our best we lost 3 of their Brave Americans and I can make absolutely 2 commitments to you and all the American people tonight 1 we will find and bring to Justice the men who did this and secondly we will get to the bottom of it and whatever wherever the facts lead us wherever they lead us we will make clear to the American public because whatever mistakes are made will not be made again when you're looking at a president Martha it seems to me that uh you should take a look at his most important responsibility that's caring for the National Security of the country and the best way to do that is take a look at how he's handled the issues of the day on Iraq the president said he would end the war Governor Romney said that was a tragic mistake we should have left 30 thou he ended it Governor Romney said that was a tragic mistake we should have left 30,000 troops there with regard to Afghanistan he said he will end the war in 2014 Governor Romney said we should not set a date number 1 and number 2 with regard to 2014 it depends when a candle Osama Bin Laden the president the first day in office I was sitting with him in the Oval Office he called in the CIA and signed an order saying my highest priority is to get Ben Laden prior to the election prior to the uh uh him being sworn in Governor Romney was asked the question about how he would proceed he said I wouldn't move Heaven and Earth to get Ben Laden he didn't understand it was more than about taking a a murder off the battlefield it was about restoring America's heart and letting terrorists around the world know if you do harm to America we will track you to the gates of hell if need be and lastly the uh the president of the United States has a has led with a steady hand and Clear Vision Governor Romney the opposite the last thing we need now is another War

RADDATZ:
Congressman Ryan

RYAN:
we mourn the loss of these 4 Americans who are murdered 1 you take a look at what has happened just in the last few weeks they sent the UN Ambassador out to say that this was because of a protest and a YouTube video it took the president 2 weeks to acknowledge that this was a terrorist attack he went to the UN and in his speech at the UN he said 6 times he talked about the YouTube video look if we are hit by terrorists we're going to call it for what it is a terrorist attack our ambassador in Paris has a marine Detachment guarding him shouldn't we have a marine Detachment guarding our ambassador in Benghazi a place where we knew that there was an Al-Qaeda cell with arms this is becoming more troubling by the day they first blamed the YouTube video now they're trying to blame the Romney Ryan ticket for making this an issue and with respect to Iraq we had the same position before the withdrawal which was we agreed with the Obama Administration let's have a status of forces agreement to make sure that we secure our gains the vice president was put in charge of those negotiations by President Obama and they failed to get the agreement we don't have a status of forces agreement because they failed to get 1 that's what we were talking about and when it comes to our veterans we owe them a great debt of gratitude for what they've done for us including your son Bo but we also want to make sure that we don't lose the things we fought so hard to get and with the respect to Afghanistan the 2014 deadline we agree with the 2014 transition but what we also want to do is make sure that we're not projecting weakness abroad and that's what happening here this Benghazi issue would be a tragedy in and of itself but unfortunately it's indicative of a broader problem and that is what we are watching on our TV screens is the unraveling of the Obama foreign policy which is making the more more more chaotic and US less safe

RADDATZ:
I I just want to talk to you about right in the middle of the crisis Governor Romney and you're talking about this again tonight talked about the weakness talked about apologies from the Obama Administration was that really appropriate right in the middle of the crisis

RYAN:
on that same day the Obama administration had the exact same position let's recall that they disavowed their own statement that they had put out earlier in the day in Cairo so we had the same position but we will it's never too early to speak out for our values we should have spoken out right away when the Green Revolution was up and starting when the mullahs in Iran were attacking their people we should not have called Bashar Assad a reformer when he was turning his Russian provided guns on his own people we should always stand up for peace for democracy for individual rights and we should not be imposing these devastating defense Cuts because what that does when we have equivocate on our values when we show that we're cutting our own defense it makes us more weak IT projects weakness and when we look weak our adversaries are much more willing to test us they're more Brazen in their attacks and our allies are less willing to

BIDEN:
with all due respect that's a bunch of malarkey and why is that so you guys not a single thing he said is accurate first of all

RADDATZ:
be specific

BIDEN:
I will be very specific number 1 the uh this lecture on Embassy Security the congressman here cut Embassy Security in his budget by 300 million dollars below what we asked for number 1 so much for the Embassy Security piece number 2 Governor Romney before he knew the facts before he even knew that our ambassador was killed he was out making a political statement which was panned by the media around the world and this talk about this this weakness I I don't understand what my friends talking about here we this is a president who's gone out and done everything he has said he was going to do this is a guy who's repaired our alliances so the rest of the world follows us again this is the guy who brought the entire world including Russia and China to bring about the most devastating most devastating uh um uh uh uh uh the most devastating efforts on uh Iran to make sure that they in fact stop with the look I I I just I mean these guys bet against America all the time

RADDATZ:
can can we talk about let me go

BIDEN:
back yeah

RADDATZ:
what were you first told about the attack why why were people talking about protests when people in the consulate first saw armed men attacking with guns there were no

BIDEN:
protesters why did that go on exactly what we were told by the intelligence Community the intelligence Community told us that as they learn more facts about exactly what happened they changed their assessment that's why there's also an investigation headed by Tom Pickering a leading Diplomat from the Reagan years who is doing an investigation as to whether or not there are any lapses what the lapses were so that they will never happen again

RADDATZ:
and they wanted more security there

BIDEN:
well we weren't told their won't want it more security again we did not know they want it more security again and by the way at the time we were told exactly we said exactly what the intelligence Community told us that they knew that was the assessment and as the intelligence Community changed their view we made it clear they changed their view that's why I said we will get to the bottom of this you know usually when there's a crisis we pull together we pull together as a nation but as I said even before we knew what happened to the Ambassador the governor is holding a press conference I was holding a press conference that's not presidential leadership

RADDATZ:
Mr Ryan I want to ask you about the Romney campaign talks a lot about No Apologies he has a book called No Apologies should the US have apologized for Americans burning qurans in Afghanistan should the US apologize for US Marines urinating on Taliban corpses

RYAN:
oh gosh yes you're any on Calvin corpses what we should not apologize bronze immediately what we should not be apologizing for are standing up for our values what we should not be doing is saying to the Egyptian people while Mubarak is cracking down on them that he's a good guy and then the next week say he ought to go what we should not be doing is rejecting claims from for calls for more security in our barracks in our marine we need Marines in Benghazi when the commander on the ground says we need more forces for security there were requests for extra security those requests were not honored look this was the anniversary of 9/11 it was Libya a country we knew we had Al-Qaeda sells there as we know Al-Qaeda and its Affiliates are on the rise in Northern Africa and we did not give our ambassador in Benghazi a marine detachment of course there's an investigation so we can make sure that this never happens again but when it comes to speaking up for our values we should not apologize for those here's the problem look at all the various issues out there and it's unraveling before our eyes the vice president talks about sanctions on Iran they got we've had

RADDATZ:
let's move to Iran I'd I'd actually like to move to Iran because there's really no bigger National Security this country is facing both President Obama and Governor Romney have said they will prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon even if that means military action
