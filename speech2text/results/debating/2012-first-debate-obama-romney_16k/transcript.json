        "Contents": "well thank you very much Jim for this opportunity I want to thank Governor Romney and the University of Denver for your hospitality uh there are a lot of points I want to make to tonight but uh the most important 1 is that uh 20 years ago I became the luckiest man on Earth because Michelle Obama agreed to marry me and so I just want to wish uh sweetie uh you happy anniversary and let you know that a year from now we will not be celebrating it in front of 40 million people uh you know 4 years ago we went through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression millions of jobs were lost the Auto industry was on the brink of collapse uh the financial system had Frozen up and because of the resilience and the determination of the American people uh We've begun to fight our way back over the last 30 months we've seen 5 million jobs in the private sector created the Auto industry has come roaring back and housing has begun to rise but we all know that we've still got a lot of work to do and so the question here tonight is not where we've been but where we're going Governor Romney has affective that says if we cut taxes skewed towards the wealthy and roll back regulations that uh will be better off I've got a different view I think we've got to invest in Education and Training I think it's important for us to develop new sources of energy here in America that we change our tax code to make sure that we're helping small businesses and companies that are investing here in the United States that we take some of the money that we're saving as we wind down 2 Warsaw and that we reduce our deficit in a balanced way that allows us to make these critical Investments now It ultimately is going to be up to the voters to you which path we should take are we going to double down on the top down economic policies that helped to get us into this mess or do we Embrace a new economic patriotism that says America does best when the middle class does best and I'm looking forward to having that debate"

        "Contents": "Governor Romney 2 minutes thank you Jim it's an honor to be here with you and I appreciate the chance to be with the president I'm pleased to be at the University of Denver appreciate their welcome and also the presidential commission on these debates and congratulations to you Mr President on your anniversary I'm sure this was the most romantic place you could imagine here here with me so I congratulations um this is a very tender topic I've had the occasion over the last couple of years of meeting people across the country I was in uh Dayton Ohio and a woman grabbed my arm and she said I've been out of work since May can you help me and yesterday was at a rally in Denver and a woman came up to her with a baby in her arms and said Anne my husband has had 4 jobs in 3 years part-time jobs he's lost his most recent job and we've now just lost our home can you help us and the answer is yes we can help but it's going to take a different path not the 1 we've been on not the 1 the president describes as a top down uh cut taxes for the rich that's not what I'm going to do my plan has 5 basic parts 1 get us energy independent North American Energy independent that creates about 4 million jobs number 2 open up more trade particularly in Latin America crack down on China if and when they cheat Number 3 make sure our people have the skills they need to succeed and the best schools in the world who are a far away from that now number 4 get us to a balanced budget number 5 Champion small business it's small business that creates the jobs in America and over the last 4 years small business people have decided that America may not be the place to open a new business because new business startups are down to a 30-year low I know what it takes to get small business growing again to hire people now I'm concerned that the path that we're on has just been unsuccessful the president has a view very similar to The View he had when he ran for years ago that a bigger government spending more taxing more regulating more if you will trickle down government would work that's not the right answer for America I'll restore the Vitality that gets America working again thank you"
