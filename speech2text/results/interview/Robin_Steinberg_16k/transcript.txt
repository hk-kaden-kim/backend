Chris:
welcome to the Ted interview I'm Chris Anderson this is the podcast Series where I sit down with a Ted speaker and we get to dive much deeper into their ideas than was possible during their Ted Talk today it's an absolute Delight to have with me Robin Steinberg Robbins a public defense lawyer who's working to disrupt America's system of cash bail and she is a force of nature look we all know the shocking numbers the United States incarcerates more people per capita than almost any Nation on the planet but what you may not know is that on any given night in America almost half a million people go to sleep in those concrete jail cells who have not been convicted of anything these Mothers and Fathers and Sons and Daughters are there for 1 reason and 1 reason only they cannot afford to pay the price of their freedom Robin is out to change this she's being backed by an initiative from Ted called the audacious project which offers significant funding for truly bold ideas her ideas as bold as they get and we're going to be talking about all of this in the next hour I'm telling you once you've met Robin you cannot get her out of your head Robin welcome thank you it's nice to be here Robin I'd love to start with your own story how did you become a public defender even so

Robin:
I went to law school um many many years ago thinking I wanted to be a women's rights litigator was committed to that idea um I got to law school and I began to work in a women's prison and was so struck by the conditions of jail why people were in jail who was in jail all black and brown women from low income communities here in New York I listened to their stories um which have stuck with me my whole career um they felt railroaded by the system they felt like they didn't have Advocates that cared they had very low opinions of their public defenders which got me interested in what was going on in the criminal justice system uh so my third year in law school I enrolled in a criminal defense clinic and I began to represent people in Manhattan Criminal Court and quite frankly I think I stepped foot in that courtroom my very first day and I never looked back

Chris:
okay so so talk about holistic Public Defense what does that mean

Robin:
so I started my public defender career um in a traditional public defender office in The Legal Aid Society of Nassau County and then later I transferred into the Legal Aid Society in New York City and I loved the work I loved everybody I was working with I thought my colleagues were incredible I thought the clients were inspiring in the face of All Odds and I loved representing people in courtrooms but I also could always see the gaps in what we were doing I saw the disconnect between the communities that clients came from and the people that were defending them I saw the gaps in what kind of representation we were providing um when clients would sit across the table and I would be focusing on their criminal case and they would continually ask me questions about their housing or about their kids or about um something else that was on their mind and I realized that an arrest was never just an arrest and that there were these other issues that were both driving people into the criminal legal system but also a whole host of collateral consequences for that arrest and that people were often times concerned more about that than the actual criminal case in front of us so I began to think there has to be more to this picture so if effectively you couldn't

Chris:
effectively defend them as a public defender without paying attention to some of these other issues what did that actually look like I mean did that mean that you sort of go from legal work into social assistance of some kind how did you actually do that

Robin:
so I think really dedicated public defenders in any office whether they're holistic or not holistic try to do the extra work beyond the criminal case so of course it meant focusing on you know the burden of proof and the evidence against the client on the criminal case and working out either disposition or going to trial but it also meant sometimes picking up the phone and calling the Housing Authority right picking up the phone and calling the Child Welfare worker that was knocking on my client's door trying to take their kids from them because of their arrest um intervening in advocacy ways that are non-traditional and not in the lane of sort of criminal defense in the way we think about it but that are 100% connected to the criminal case these systems all talk to each other and if we as public defenders weren't actually providing advocacy and Council in those other areas the system was going to win
