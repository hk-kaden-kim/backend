Chris:
welcome to the Ted interview I'm Chris Andersen and this is the podcast Series where I sit down with a Ted speaker and we get to dive much deeper into their ideas than was possible during their TED Talk my guest today is Sam Harris philosopher neuroscientist author podcaster Sam has been at the heart of many of the most provocative conversations out there today politically I would Place him at what you might call the radical Center a Stern critic of Donald Trump but also of political correctness for example he has infuriated people on both left and right in almost equal measure but he has also delighted many many people because of his Clarity of thought and his fearlessness in how he expresses those thoughts Sam's podcast waking up is super popular I'm a regular listener and he's also famed for his book called the moral landscape that was the subject of his first TED Talk

Sam:
most people probably hear think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life questions like what is worth living for what is worth dying for what constitutes a good life so I'm going to argue that this is an illusion of the separation between science and human values is an illusion and actually quite a dangerous 1 at this point in human history so the debate is over the

Chris:
nature of morality specifically is there such a thing as objective moral truth or is morality inherently subjective in which case all moral statements are ultimately just statements about the values and individual or a culture happens to hold so let's give an example here I mean look if I say something like it's wrong to lie or we should all stop eating animals are those ultimately just your personal moral values or might there be a sense in which they can objectively be judged to be true or false if you believe in God there's an easy enough answer to this question good is what God has revealed to us is good he's created human beings with consciences and with the holy book that sets out what is right and what is wrong but most modern philosophers academic scientists don't think you can Outsource morality to God they would say there is a fundamental difference in the world between facts and values facts are statements about the real world they can be true or false values are human Creations they differ between different cultures we can debate them but ultimately there is no objective Arbiter of the truth of a moral statement what's interesting about Sam Harris is that although he definitely doesn't believe in God he does believe that statements about moral values are ultimately objective statements in his view we can discover the truth about those statements through an Ever deeper knowledge of science of psychology for example of how human societies operate and of the exercise of reason there's a lot at stake here if some Harris is wrong and the majority of scientists and philosophers are right then it's hard to see how there can be such a thing as moral progress if a moral system is simply the subjective values that a culture creates it puts a limit on how much you can argue against views you disagree with like the sanctity of life or child marriage you just have no real answer to the position look this is what I and my family going back Generations choose to believe
