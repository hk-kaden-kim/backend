        "Contents": "it was certainly an incredibly disarming talk she got a big Standing Ovation and changed I think how a lot of people thought about Muslims of course Islam is often criticized for the actions taken in its name so my goal with this conversation is to understand Islam better while at the same time not shying away from hard questions and so Dahlia I'm delighted to have you here today that really was a remarkable talk you gave I guess it's so tempting to categorize people we don't know in that talk you helped us know you what was the reaction to the talk"

        "Contents": "well I I I really wanted that talk to be a gift I wanted it to be um a a contribution to the audience's understanding I I I wanted to be up there to give them the gift of a new idea and what came out of it was such a almost like a a magical reception I mean I had so many people tell me how much they they learned and how much they really changed I remember 1 1 particular person which uh right after the talk actually at the conference he was there as security for 1 of your guests I'm not sure who and he said I uh I think that I was really struggling with some of these ideas you were talking about I I think that I I was really suffering from some islamophobia but your talk completely changed my mind and I want to thank you and I've gotten these messages from all over the world since the talk I I remember 1 I got from Jerusalem um a Jewish Israeli wrote me and said uh that she related so much to the ideas of the talk and how often times her father who's an orthodox Jew is mistaken for a Muslim when he's traveling in Europe and and he's he himself ironically has suffered from islamophobia so I I thought it was it was a great opportunity to to build a bridge to reveal a little bit more about the humanity of of Ordinary People of Muslims and and I was really important to me at the end of The Talk to make sure that no 1 thought I was an exception that no 1 could sort of dismiss my experiences just that 1 person uh with as the exception to all others I I really do believe that I am entirely ordinary and my story is so representative of so many other people"
