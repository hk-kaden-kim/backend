Chris:
welcome to the Ted

Ken:
interview I'm Chris Andersen and this is the podcast Series where I sit down with a Ted speaker and we get to dive much deeper into their ideas and was possible during their TED Talk and today I couldn't be more excited because I'm here with none other than Sir Ken Robinson so Ken is the man responsible for the most viewed Ted Talk of all time it's been seen more than 50 million times now A talk called do schools kill creativity he recorded it back in 2006 it was 1 of the first 6 TED Talks that we ever released and probably that talk did as much as any other to really put TED Talks as a whole on the map I had a great story recently of a little girl who was in a drawing lesson she was 6 and she was at the back drawing and the teacher said this little girl how to ever paid attention and in this drawing lesson she did and the teacher was fascinated she went over to her and she said what are you drawing and the girl said I'm drawing a picture of God and the teacher said but nobody knows what God looks like and the girl said they went in the minute the idea he spoke about seemed to really strike a nerve with people it felt as if millions and millions of people around the world had had this experience of being at school and somehow their own creativity not being heard or recognized or felt or developed properly I believe this passionately that we don't grow into creativity we grow out of it or rather than we get educated out of it the Ken has been a scholar of Education pretty much all his life as a professor a policy adviser and an author and I'm so excited today to have a chance to ask him more about his ideas Sir Ken Robinson welcome it's a real pleasure Chris thank you why don't we start by finding out a bit about you and your own education

Chris:
well I'm from Liverpool I was born there in 1950 I'm 1 of 7 children we grew up with no money we weren't aware of it which 1 by the way I'm

Ken:
Number 5 number 5 so you had to you had to really carve out some attention in the family

Chris:
well yes I mean that my first 3 siblings all had middle names and my parents kind of ran out of steam down they got to my end of the of the list and I I was just glad not to be called 5 so yeah so I grew up there and um I had no idea growing up what I might ever go on to do if I ever go on to do anything at all so I always been a big theme in the work I do that we create our own lives it doesn't really matter where you start from

Ken:
uh as a child you were hit by quite a severe onus will you will you talk about that yeah

Chris:
until I was 4 my father was convinced I was going to be the family soccer player I showed an early in precocious talent for a evidently I was you know strong and and quick had good eye hand coordination and my dad had been a semi-professional football player himself but in the early 50s there was an epidemic of polio myelitis which spread right across Europe and North America and and I got it yeah so at the age of 4 I was uh in hospital with polio I was in for 8 months and I was you know paralyzed overnight pretty much and I was thrown into uh the world of special education and I went to actually in the early 50s people went very good at euphemisms we hadn't really got the hang of them so so I was I went to the Margaret bevon school for the physically handicapped and where I was in the company of a lot of other people with you know calipers and braces and in wheelchairs and various sorts of uh physical illnesses or or handicaps and through the whole family is that world
