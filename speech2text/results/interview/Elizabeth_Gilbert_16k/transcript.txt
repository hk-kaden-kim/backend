Chris:
hi everyone welcome to the Ted interview this is Chris Anderson the guy lucky enough to run Ted here at Ted where borderline obsessed with the power of ideas ideas are such a weird things you know they get inside your head and they might just give you a little piece of knowledge or they might actually really reshape how you see the world they can even change who you are that this powerful common currency that humans have and can share with each other now we normally share them in the form of TED Talks which are you know recorded on a stage 12 15 18 minutes at a time but here's the thing about ideas they don't just land perfectly formed they want to be critiqued played with iterated on and sometimes that takes longer than 18 minutes so in the series I'll be having our long conversations with some of the most compelling Ted speakers to dive deeper learn more and there is no better medium to do that dance than podcasting on this first episode my guest is author Elizabeth Gilbert 15 years ago in response to a personal crisis she took a trip around the world and wrote about it and that book Eat Pray Love became a global phenomenon topping bestseller lists for years in 2009 Liz came to the Ted stage to talk about how hard it was to follow that success with another book so Liz started a research project where she explored the question how do other societies conceive of creativity and once again a very personal question for Liz a desire to understand how creativity happens turn into inspiration for millions of viewers and a book called Big magic Liz has always been open to new possibilities 2 summers ago she announced the amicable ending of her marriage and a new relationship with her best friend the writer rayya Elias who had been diagnosed with terminal cancer Reya passed away in January of this year Liz that fact makes it all the more astonishing that you're willing to come now and spend time with me

Elizabeth:
welcome I'm so happy to be here with You Chris thank you so much you always invite me to things and I always say yes because I always know it's going to be good well um I can't imagine what you've been

Chris:
through this past couple years um but let's let's perhaps not start that let's why don't we start with the subject of your Ted Talk and the subject of big magic which is that these insights that you have around creativity they are not the usual story we hear about creativity in the Ted Talk you put out there this notion that creative genius wasn't something that people have it's not like their Ordinary People and then there are these Geniuses who have this sort of special ability to do extraordinary things that genius is actually something that comes from the outside talk about that

Elizabeth:
yeah well I I want to start by saying that when you describe my ideas about creativity as being unusual I agree with you but only to the extent that they are unusual only very recently in history my idea is about creativity are actually very classical and they're very normal and they're very human for how human beings regarded creativity for nearly all of human history until basically the middle of the 19th century you know that would happened was there was this this really toxic revolution in creativity that I like to I like to blame on the German Romantics um you know that put the individual at the center of the story a very narcissistic version of creativity a very great man based version of creativity and it all came from you it all came from you from your talent from your greatness from your efforts and generally speaking and in a very romanticized way from your struggle in your pain and your suffering and so what became idealized was the suffering itself as the badge of honor of a creative person which all you have to do is look at any of the Arts in modern Western Society to see how idealized that still is and I don't personally believe that that's how human beings made art for most of civilization and for most of humanity I think that art and creativity have always been a conversation between a human being and a mystery
