Marcus:
improving our performance with customers is all about changing the company culture so we need a message or a slogan perhaps we even need an image that everyone sees every day on their desks to remind them of the goal like

Paul:
a mission statement

Marcus:
well thought of recognizable mission statements tend to be forgotten or they're too long but I don't want to rule out any idea that this stage so what does I'd like us to do this morning is spend an hour or so brainstorming some ideas to see what we can come up with and just a reminder this is a brainstorm so all ideas are welcome we're not here to evaluate the ideas yet we just want to get as many as possible to get us started perhaps we should begin with

David:
the word customer in the center and see what comes from that

Marcus:
okay does anyone have any other thoughts maybe it's too early in the day

Paul:
yes Anna

Anna:
I was thinking of good customer service or maybe you're looking for something more catchy

Marcus:
no no that's fine don't feel you have to come up with a slogan or anything let's just get some ideas in front of

Paul:
us customer care customer help customer service sorry we've got that 1 already

Anna:
how about doing things better

Maja:
customers doing what do you mean

Anna:
oh I didn't know we were only thinking about using the word customer I was trying to think of what it

Maja:
is that we're actually trying to do but I think Marcus is looking for something more about the customer

Marcus:
know I'm not looking for anything definite at this stage I really want this just to be a brainstorm so anything is fine we don't need any discussion at this stage about what's good or bad let's just focus on generating ideas so Sally what exactly did you

Paul:
say

Anna:
doing things better

Paul:
doing things better

Marcus:
doing things better good anyone else

Maja:
in that case what about more effectively better service more helpful

Paul:
getting there together this is good getting some

Marcus:
nice ideas now

Maja:
staff what they need to do or or do you want something that reminds them of the goal Marcos

Marcus:
I want something that does both I think do you want to say something David you've been very quiet so far any comments

David:
sorry yes I was just thinking that perhaps we need to think of where we are now and where we have to get to um can you elaborate I mean at the moment we don't even offer what some of our competitors can offer in terms of customer service we have to equal them

Paul:
I like that and equal symbol

Anna:
is that a useful image 1 thing I've told my staff is that we have to go beyond what customers would normally expect if we only provide what other companies do in terms of level of service then that isn't enough so more than equals then in that case

Marcus:
this perhaps

David:
plus customers customers plus customers plus 1

Anna:
the customer plus program

David:
very nice the customer plus program

Marcus:
what we think yes

Maja:
I like it

David:
and it would be a good name if you wanted to offer some kind of loyalty program or rewards for coming back to us

Marcus:
yeah I agree but let's keep a few more ideas coming we can come back to this 1 later uh so far we've been thinking about this very much from our own perspective perhaps it would be useful to think about it more from the customer's point of view now Sally you said doing things better let's explore that a bit more from the customers perspective if you were the customer what would you want us to do better

Anna:
speaking as a customer I'd say I want my calls answered more quickly

Maja:
I I want to feel that I matter

Anna:
yes I want to be listened to

David:
that's it I want to feel that they want me to explain my problem not that I'm

Marcus:
some sort of interruption to their day oh this is great let let me just note down some of these words we had uh

Paul:
uh matter uh listen want to help it makes me think that the customer

Marcus:
is our business

David:
fantastic

Marcus:
well let's see where these takers
