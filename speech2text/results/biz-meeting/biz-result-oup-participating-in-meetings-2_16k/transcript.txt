Paul:
right shall we get started wow we're here to talk about a new training program for the call center David I asked you to come because you were in the market research we did so I thought you could give us a short summary of The findings and Anna obviously it's your customer service team so it will be affected by this

Maria:
yes

Paul:
so we thought you might have some ideas on the best way to approach the training program and Maria will be developing and running the training okay David could you run us through the main points from the research

David:
sure um we worked with a market research agency over a period of a few weeks to gather information about our customers and what they thought of us and the results were well mixed

Maria:
sorry can I just check why was this research done had there been complaints or

David:
some complaints yes but also we are losing customers in the region and we wanted to know why sorry

Maria:
I'm not sure I understand what's the research about getting customer points of view or about customer profiles

David:
it was to get customer feedback on the company and its services

Maria:
right I see

David:
so the results showed a few areas where customers were not happy 1 of the most common how shall I put it issues was with the call center

Maria:
I see can you be more specific

David:
well basically it seems that customers feel they are not getting good service and they are leaving us for another supplier

Maria:
right you saying customers are leaving us because of the service from the staff or could there be other reasons to I mean could it be that we haven't got very good systems in place for our staff

Paul:
could be Anna

Maria:
look I have no problem with giving the staff a refresher course but starting completely from scratch seems like a waste of time and money they will receive training when they start anyway

Paul:
yes that's a good point Anna and we don't know yet if we will have to start from scratch it may be that we haven't done enough to monitor their activity and that a simple refresher course will be enough or it may be that we have to look at customer contact from start to finish and try to implement some new protocols Maria

Maria:
yes that's right I'm sure there's a way of dealing with a sensitively Anna I realize it's not easy for you to suggest more training for your staff so I wondered if we could start with a review of the current training approach and look at what we need to do to address the problems brought up in the survey yeah could do that but I would need to look at the full report first of course um and I understand your point about possibly wasting time and money is so perhaps you and I could look at the report together yes okay and then we'll be able to decide what needs addressing and how if it's more training or even a complete systems overhaul good

Paul:
idea uh I bought in copies of the report perhaps we could start with the highlights first
