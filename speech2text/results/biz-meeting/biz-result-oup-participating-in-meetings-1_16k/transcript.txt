Marcus:
now you'll know why I've called this meeting uh sales figures for our region are down and we need to address this as soon as we can so I'd like to start by asking mayor to talk us through the figures okay

Maja:
Maya fine

Marcus:
and then we can take a look at the products were offering and compare them with the competition so my over to you

Maja:
thanks Marcus well I prepared some handouts to show you how the figures are looking if we look at sales year to date so in order to meet budget this year we will in my opinion have to start some cost-saving measures

Anna:
what do you mean by that redundancies that's 1 possibility I can't agree with you there we need a strong work force

Marcus:
okay thanks mayor look cost cutting is something that we need to think about but we also need to stop the downturn in sales and regain market share so can I bring you in here David any comments

David:
well it's hard to know what the problem is our products are competitive so

Marcus:
they're not getting better offers from the competition

David:
I don't think so how about I talk you through our office at the moment I've prepared some handouts

Marcus:
yes go ahead it will be good to look at the details okay thanks David that was all useful information so Anna can we turn to you now do you have any ideas why this downturn is happening

Anna:
well it's true we are seeing a decrease in custom in our region there's also been an increase in customers canceling new contracts within 14 days so

David:
but do you know why do the customers say why they don't like our office I personally feel that this is Vital Information I mean if I can

Anna:
finish what I was saying I'd like to suggest we review our customer account procedures from first Contact to after sales care I mean perhaps it would be a good idea to start with that and see if the sales figures improve

Marcus:
thanks Anna what do you 2 think of that

Maja:
can I make another suggestion I think we need to see the whole picture from the customer's point of view the customer survey perhaps that would be a big project it would need

Anna:
a project team which means taking staff from other departments

Maja:
actually I was thinking about hiring an external researcher get a neutral view on our position in the market and customers views on us

Marcus:
oh I like that idea I think it could be very useful information

Anna:
which department pays for it though

Marcus:
we can talk about that in a minute do you agree in principle though that we need to understand the cause of the problem

Anna:
yes I suppose so

Marcus:
good David could you look for a market research company we could work with on this sure great well let's move on then shall we
