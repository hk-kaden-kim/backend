Marcus:
Now you all know why I’ve called this 
meeting. Sales figures for our region are down – 
we need to address this as soon as we can. So I’d 
like to start by asking Maja to talk us through the 
figures, OK, Maja?

Maja:
Fine.

Marcus:
And then we can take a look at the 
products we’re offering and compare them with 
the competition. So, Maja, over to you.

Maja:
Thanks, Marcus. Well, I’ve prepared some 
handouts to show you how the figures are 
looking. If we look at sales year to date ...
... So in order to meet budget this year 
we will, in my opinion, have to start some 
cost-saving measures.

Anna:
What do you mean by that? Redundancies?

Maja:
That’s one possibility.

Anna:
I can’t agree with you there. We need a 
strong workforce.

Marcus:
OK, thanks, Maja. Look, cost-cutting is 
something that we need to think about, but we 
also need to stop the downturn in sales and 
regain market share. Can I bring you in here, 
David – any comments?

David:
Well it’s hard to know what the problem is. 
Our products are competitive...

Marcus:
So they’re not getting better offers from 
the competition?

David:
I don’t think so. How about I talk you 
through our offers at the moment? I’ve prepared 
some handouts.

Marcus:
Yes, go ahead. It’ll be good to look at 
the details.
...

Marcus:
OK, thanks, David. That was all useful 
information. So Anna, can we turn to you now? 
Do you have any ideas why this downturn 
is happening? 

Anna:
Well, it’s true that we are seeing a decrease 
in custom in our region. There’s also been an 
increase in customers cancelling new contracts 
within 14 days. So ...

David:
But do you know why? Do the customers say 
why they don’t like our offers? I personally feel 
that this is vital information. I mean if we can’t ...

Anna:
If I can finish what I was saying. I’d like 
to suggest we review our customer account 
procedures. From first contact to after-sales care. 
Perhaps it would be a good idea to start with that 
and see if the sales figures improve.

Marcus:
Thanks, Anna. What do you two think 
of that?

Maja:
Can I make another suggestion? I think 
we need to see the whole picture – from the 
customers’ point of view – a customer survey 
perhaps.

Anna:
That would be a big project. It would need 
a project team which means taking staff from 
other departments...

Maja:
Actually I was thinking about hiring an 
external researcher – get a neutral view on our 
position in the market, and customers’ views on us.

Marcus:
Oh I like that idea. I think it could be very 
useful information.

Anna:
Which department pays for it though?

Marcus:
We can talk about that in a minute. Do 
you agree, in principle, though, that we need to 
understand the cause of the problem?

Anna:
Yes, I suppose so.

Marcus:
Good. David, could you look for a market 
research company we could work with on this?

David:
Sure.

Marcus:
Great. Well let’s move on then, shall we? 
...
