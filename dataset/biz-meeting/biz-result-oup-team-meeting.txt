Paul:
Anyway, shall we start with an update 
from everyone? Can we try and keep this to 
20 minutes, though, so we have time for the 
main item afterwards. So, how are things 
going? Maria? What’s happening in the Training 
Department this week?


Maria:
So far so good. We have two external 
trainers in this week. One of them is working 
with call centre staff at the other site, so I hope 
they all turn up.

Paul:
What do you mean?

Maria:
Well, there were lots of absences for the last 
training we had at the call centre. I’m surprised 
really. It’s in paid time and you’d think people 
would enjoy having some training.

Paul:
But they have to go. It’s not really their 
decision to go or not. Did you speak to 
Customer Services?

Maria:
No, I was going to do that today. Should I 
speak to Anna?

Paul:
Yes. In fact, I’m meeting Anna today so I’ll 
mention it.

Maria:
Can you let me know how that goes, just so 
I know what I can do next?

Paul:
Yes, I will.
And ... er, what about the intranet training? 
How are things going with that?

Maria:
We are waiting for IT to say they’re ready. I 
think there have been some delays but now they 
are telling me it’ll be ready next month. I have an 
update meeting this week with Matt and Lucy.

Paul:
They really are behind on that aren’t they? So, 
is that everything for the training department?

Maria:
I am preparing something for David in 
Marketing on my idea for a school’s day.

Karina:
What’s that then?

Maria:
We might be sponsoring a one-day event for 
schools to inform students about energy – where 
it comes from, how we use it, that type of thing. 

Karina:
Oh.

Paul:
Be careful with that one Maria.

Maria:
How do you mean?

Paul:
Well really it should all come under 
Marketing. I’m happy that you’re involved but I 
don’t want it to come out of the Training budget.

Maria:
But what about my time on it?

Paul:
I’m just saying watch how much time it takes. 
I know David. He’ll have you organizing the 
whole event. 

Maria:
Oh, OK.

Paul:
So that’s quite a lot there, Maria. Let’s just 
recap. I’m going to get back to you when I’ve 
spoken to Anna about the call centre training. 
You’re going to speak to Matt and Lucy about 
the intranet training, and you’re going to proceed 
with caution with David on the schools event – 
please keep me informed on that one.

Maria:
Will do.

Paul:
OK, so ... who’s next? Recruitment, Karina? 

Karina:
Well, we have three applicants for the post 
of Finance Assistant.

Paul:
Are all the interviews this week?  

Karina:
Yes, they are. But I’m away tomorrow so 
somebody needs to interview.

Paul:
Can’t Maja do it? The applicants are applying 
to be in her team.

Karina:
Yes, but I think one of us should be there.

Paul:
OK. Leave it with me. 

Karina:
Anyway, the applicant is Monica.

Paul:
Monica? Monica on Reception? You just said 
she’s off sick.

Karina:
I know. But her interview’s tomorrow so we 
have to assume that she’ll be there.

Paul:
Sorry, so just to recap. I’m interviewing 
Monica with Maja tomorrow. At what time?

Karina:
1:30.

Paul:
And who will be looking after Reception while 
she’s having her interview?

Karina:
The same temp as today I hope.

Paul:
But you won’t be there to make sure. 

Karina:
You said I could have tomorrow off.

Paul:
I know, I know. It’s fine. So who’s next? 
Ingrid, how are things going with you?
