SEBASTIAN :
It's so nice to be home.

MIA : 
I'm so glad you're home.

SEBASTIAN :
How's the play goin'?

MIA : 
Um... I'm nervous.

SEBASTIAN :
You are? Why?

MIA : 
Mmm-hmm. Because what if people show up?

SEBASTIAN :
Piece of caca. You nervous about what they think?

MIA : 
I'm nervous to do it.
I'm nervous to get up on a stage
and perform for people...
I mean, I don't need to say that to you.

SEBASTIAN :
It's gonna be incredible.

MIA : 
You don't get it, but I'm terrified.

SEBASTIAN :
They should be so lucky to see it.
I can't wait.

MIA : 
I can.
When do you leave, the morning?

SEBASTIAN :
Yeah. 6:45.

MIA : 
Ooh.

SEBASTIAN :
Boise.

MIA : 
Boise?

SEBASTIAN :
Boise.

MIA : 
To Boise!

SEBASTIAN :
You should come.

MIA : 
To Boise?

SEBASTIAN :
Yeah, you can knock that
off your bucket list.

MIA : 
Oh, that would be... really exciting.
I wish I could.
What are you doing after the tour?

SEBASTIAN :
Why can't you?

MIA : 
Come to Boise?

SEBASTIAN :
Yeah.

MIA : 
'Cause I have to rehearse.

SEBASTIAN :
But can't you rehearse anywhere?

MIA : 
Anywhere you are?

SEBASTIAN :
I mean, I guess.

MIA : 
Um... well, all my stuff is here,
and it's in two weeks,
so I don't really think that would be...

SEBASTIAN :
Okay. Well.

MIA : 
...the best idea right now, but...
I wish I could.

SEBASTIAN :
We're just gonna have to try
and see each other.
We almost never see each other.

MIA : 
I know, but when are you done?

SEBASTIAN :
What do you mean? I mean...

MIA : 
When are you finished with the whole tour?

SEBASTIAN :
After we finish, we're gonna go
and record, and then we go back on tour.
You know, we tour so we can
make the record,
so we can go back and tour the record.

MIA : 
So it's like the long haul?

SEBASTIAN :
What do you mean, "the long haul"?

MIA : 
I mean the long haul, like you're gonna
stay in this band for a long time.
On tour.

SEBASTIAN :
What did you think I was gonna do?

MIA : 
I don't...
I hadn't really thought it through.
I didn't know that the band...
was so important.

SEBASTIAN :
You didn't think it would be successful?

MIA : 
Um...
No, that's not really what I mean.
I just mean that you...
You're gonna be on tour for,
what, months now? Years?

SEBASTIAN :
Yeah. I don't believe... This is it.
I mean, it could feasibly be...
I could be on tour with this
for a couple of years, at least.
Just this record.

MIA : 
Do you like the music you're playing?

SEBASTIAN :
I don't...
I don't know what it matters.

MIA : 
Well, it matters, because if you're gonna
give up your dream,
I think it matters that you like
what you're playing on the road for years.

SEBASTIAN :
Do you like the music I'm playing?

MIA : 
Yeah. I do.
I just didn't think that you did.

SEBASTIAN :
Yeah, well...

MIA : 
You always said Keith is the worst,
and now you're gonna be on tour with him
for years, so I just didn't...

SEBASTIAN :
What are you doing right now?

MIA : 
...know if you were happy.

SEBASTIAN :
Why are you doing this?

MIA : 
I don't...

SEBASTIAN :
What do you mean, why am I doing this?

MIA : 
I thought you wanted me to do this.

SEBASTIAN :
It just sounds like now
you don't want me to do it.

MIA : 
What do you mean, I wanted you to do this?

SEBASTIAN :
This is what you wanted for me.

MIA : 
To be in this band?

SEBASTIAN :
To be in a band.
To have a steady job, you know?
To be... you know.

MIA : 
Of course I wanted you
to have a steady job,
so that you could take care of yourself
and your life
and you could start your club.

SEBASTIAN :
So I'm doing that, so I don't understand.
Why aren't we celebrating?

MIA : 
Why aren't you starting your club?

SEBASTIAN :
You said yourself no one
wants to go to that club.
No one wants to go to a club
called "Chicken on a Stick."

MIA : 
So change the name!

SEBASTIAN :
Well, no one likes jazz! Not even you!

MIA : 
I do like jazz now because of you!

SEBASTIAN :
And this is what I thought
you wanted me to do!
What am I supposed to do?
Go back to playing "Jingle Bells"?

MIA : 
I'm not saying that.
I'm saying why don't you take
what you've made and start the club?

SEBASTIAN :
Scraping pennies so I can start a club
no one wants to go to?

MIA : 
People will want to go to it
because you're passionate about it,
and people love what other people
are passionate about.
You remind people of what they forgot.

SEBASTIAN :
Not in my experience.
Well, whatever, all right?
It's just time to grow up, you know?
I have a steady job,
this is what I'm doing.
And now all of a sudden
if you had these problems,
I wish you would have said them earlier,
before I signed
on the goddamn dotted line!

MIA : 
I'm pointing out that you had a dream
that you followed,
that you were sticking to...

SEBASTIAN :
This is the dream! This is the dream.

MIA : 
This is not your dream!

SEBASTIAN :
Guys like me work their whole lives
to be in something
that's successful, that people like.
You know?
I mean, I'm finally in something
that people enjoy.

MIA :
Since when do you care about being liked?

SEBASTIAN :
Just 'cause I don't enjoy it,
it doesn't matter.

MIA :
Why do you care so much about being liked?

SEBASTIAN :
You're an actress!
What are you talking about?

SEBASTIAN :
Maybe you just liked me
when I was on my ass
'cause it made you
feel better about yourself.

MIA :
Are you kidding?

SEBASTIAN :
No.
