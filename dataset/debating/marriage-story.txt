NICOLE: 
You're being so much like your father.

CHARLIE:
Do not compare me to my father!

NICOLE: 
I didn't compare you to him. I said you were acting like him.

CHARLIE:
You're exactly like your mother. Everything you were complaining about her, youâ€™re doing. You're suffocating Henry.

NICOLE: 
First of all, I love my mother. She was wonderful mother.

CHARLIE:
I'm just repeating what you told me.

NICOLE: 
Secondly, how dare you compare my mothering to my mother! I may be like my father, but I am not like my mother!

CHARLIE:
You are! And you're like my father! You're also like my mother! You're all the bad things about all of these people! But mostly your mother. When we'd lie in bed together, sometimes I would look at you and see her and just feel so gross!

NICOLE: 
I felt repulsed when you touched me!

CHARLIE:
You're a slob. I made the beds, closed cabinets...

NICOLE: 
The thought of having sex with you... makes me wanna peel my skin off.

CHARLIE:
You'll never be happy, in LA or anywhere. You'll think you found some better opposite guy than me, and in a few years, you'll rebel against him because you need to have your voice, but you don't want a voice. You just wanna fucking complain about not having a voice!

NICOLE: 
I think about being married to you, and that woman is a stranger to me. I mean, we had a child's marriage.

CHARLIE:
You've regressed. You've gone back to your life before you met me, it's pathetic.

NICOLE: 
People used to tell me that you were too selfish to be a great artist. And I used to defend you. They were absolutely right.

CHARLIE:
All your best acting is behind you. You're back to being a hack!

NICOLE: 
You gaslighted me! You're a fucking villain!

CHARLIE:
You want to present yourself as a victim because it's a good legal strategy? Fine, but you and I both know you chose this life! You wanted it until you didn't! You used me so you could get out of LA.

NICOLE: 
I didn't use you.

CHARLIE:
You did and then you blamed me for it! You always made me aware of what I was doing wrong, how I was falling short! Life with you was joyless!

NICOLE: 
What, so then you had to go and fuck someone else?

CHARLIE:
You shouldn't be upset that I fucked her! You should be upset that I had a laugh with her!

NICOLE: 
Do you love her?

CHARLIE:
No. But she didn't hate me. You hated me.

NICOLE: 
You hated me. You fucked somebody we worked with.

CHARLIE:
You stopped having sex with me in the last year. I never cheated on you.

NICOLE: 
That was cheating on me!

CHARLIE:
But there was so much I could have done. I was a director in my 20s who came from nothing and was suddenly on the cover of fucking Time Out New York! I was hot shit and I wanted to fuck everybody and I didn't. And I loved you and I didn't wanna lose you. But I'm in my 20s and I didn't wanna lose that too, and I kinda did! And you wanted so much so fast. I didn't even wanna get married. I mean, fuck it! There's so much I didn't do.

NICOLE: 
Thanks for that!

CHARLIE:
You're welcome!

NICOLE: 
I can't believe I have to know you forever!

CHARLIE:
Oh, you're fucking insane! And you're fucking winning!

NICOLE: 
Are you kidding me? I wanted to be married. I'd already lost! You didn't love me as much as I loved you!

CHARLIE:
What does that have to do with LA? What?

NICOLE: 
You're so merged with your own selfishness, you don't even identify it as selfishness anymore! You're such a dick!

CHARLIE:
Every day I wake up and I hope you're dead! Dead like... if I could guarantee Henry would be okay, I'd hope you'd get an illness and then get hit by a car and die!

CHARLIE:
Oh, God! I'm sorry.

NICOLE: 
Me too.
