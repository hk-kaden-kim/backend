HASSAN : 
Respectfully, that's not the issue--

KEANE : 
I understand
given your religious affiliation,
you might find the fact that your son is
interested in the Bible offensive…

HASSAN : 
Not at all.

KEANE : 
…I suppose.
But I would say
that if he's interested in Jesus,
why not allow him
to learn a little about it?

HASSAN : 
That's so not the issue, and thank you
for this opportunity to clarify.
Uh, he knows all about Jesus.

KEANE : 
Well, I imagine not quite all.

HASSAN:
Muslims believe
that Jesus is a prophet of God,
and that the Injeel, the Bible,
was revealed to him as the Torah
was revealed to Moses before that.
See, we love Jesus. And we love
the message that was revealed to him.

KEANE : 
Well!
I suppose we learn
something new every day, don't we?

HASSAN:
But we also believe,
after the time of Jesus,
thanks to the interference of men,
there were deviations in Christianity.
People altered the message.
Priests, popes, kings.
That's why there's
so, so many versions of the Bible.
People got in there, made their changes.

KEANE : 
I don't think this is relevant.

HASSAN:
Okay, we do though believe that the Bible
contains some of the original word of God.

KEANE : 
That's very generous of you.

HASSAN:
But we also believe that God
revealed the Quran as the final message.
Never to be altered.
To reassert the original revelations
of the previous prophets.

KEANE : 
I don't think that
this is the place to discuss
where our beliefs
about scripture might diverge.

HASSAN:
Exactly.
There it is. That's the issue.
That's why I think
some of the people in this room,
including myself, are a little concerned.
See, Muslims encourage
everyone to seek knowledge,
so I am more than comfortable
with my son studying a Bible.
Thrilled, actually. I've done it myself.
But where I think there's an issue
is that this is a public school.
That's the thing.
And I think what's concerning
some of us is not the Bible itself,
but that it was handed out.
Distributed to the kids here.
I just ask you to consider how you'd feel,
if you sent your child to a public school…

KEANE : 
Sheriff.

HASSAN:
…and they came home
with a copy of the Quran,
asking about the Prophet Muhammad.
You'd feel it was an issue.
If I went around handing out
copies of the Quran
to the children on this island,
purely in the interest
of the pursuit of knowledge,
I'd expect you
chase me out of town, Miss Keane.
