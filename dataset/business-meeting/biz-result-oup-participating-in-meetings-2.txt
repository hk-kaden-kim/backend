Paul:
Right, shall we get started? Well, we’re here to 
talk about a new training programme for the call 
centre. David, I asked you to come because you 
were involved in the market research we did, so I 
thought you could give us a short summary of the 
findings. And Anna, obviously it’s your customer 
service teams who will be affected by this.

Anna:
Yes, exactly.

Paul:
So we thought you might have some ideas 
on the best way to approach the training 
programme. And Maria will be developing and 
running the training. OK, David, could you run us 
through the main points from the research?

David:
Sure. Um, we worked with a market 
research agency over a period of a few weeks 
to gather information about our customers and 
what they thought of us. And the results were ... 
well mixed.

Maria:
Sorry, can I just check – why was this 
research done? Had there been complaints or ...?

David:
Some complaints, yes, but also we are losing 
customers in the region and we wanted to know 
why.

Maria:
Sorry, I’m not sure I understand. Was the 
research about getting customer points of view 
or about customer profiles?

David: 
It was to get customer feedback on the 
company and its services.

Maria:
Right, I see.

David:
So the results showed a few areas where 
customers were not happy. One of the most 
common ... how shall I put it ... issues, was with 
the call centre.

Maria:
I see. Can you be more specific?

David:
Well, basically, it seems that customers feel 
they are not getting good service, and they are 
leaving us for another supplier.

Maria:
Right. So are you saying customers are 
leaving us because of the service from the staff, 
or could there be other reasons too? I mean, 
could it be that we haven’t got very good systems 
in place for our staff?

Paul:
Yeah, could be. Anna?

Anna: 
Look, I have no problem with giving the staff 
a refresher course, but starting completely from 
scratch seems like a waste of time and money. 
They all receive training when they start anyway.

Paul:
Yes, that’s a good point, Anna, and we don’t 
know yet if we will have to start from scratch. It 
may be that we haven’t done enough to monitor 
their activity, and that a simple refresher course 
will be enough. Or it may be that we have to look 
at customer contact from start to finish, and try 
to implement some new protocols. Maria?

Maria:
Yes, that’s right. I’m sure there’s a way of 
dealing with this sensitively. Anna, I realise it’s 
not easy for you to suggest more training for 
your staff. So I wondered if we could start with 
a review of the current training approach and 
to look at what we need to do to address the 
problems brought up in the survey. 

Anna:
Yes, we could do that.

Maria:
But, I will need to look at the full report 
first, of course. Um, Anna, I understand your 
point about possibly wasting time and money, 
so perhaps you and I look could at the report 
together?

Anna:
Yes, OK.

Maria:
Then we’ll be able to decide what needs 
addressing and how – if it’s more training or even 
a complete systems overhaul.

Paul:
Good idea. I’ve brought in copies of the 
report. Perhaps we could start with the 
highlights first.
