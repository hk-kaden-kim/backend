Marcus:
Improving our performance with customers 
is all about changing the company culture. So we 
need a message or a slogan. Perhaps we even need 
an image that everyone sees every day on their 
desks to remind them of the goal. 

Paul:
Like a mission statement?

Marcus:
Sort of, but I’d like us to think of 
something short and instantly recognizable. 
Mission statements tend to be forgotten or 
they’re too long. But I don’t want to rule out any 
ideas at this stage. So what I’d like us to do this 
morning is spend an hour or so brainstorming 
some ideas to see what we can come up with. 
Just a reminder: this is a brainstorm, so all ideas 
are welcome.
We’re not here to evaluate the ideas yet. We just 
want to get as many as possible to get us started.
David: Perhaps we should begin with the word 
CUSTOMER in the centre and see what comes 
from that.

Marcus:
OK. ... Does anyone have any other 
thoughts? Maybe it’s too early in the day. Yes, 
Anna?

Anna:
I was thinking of ‘Good customer service’. Or 
maybe you’re looking for something more catchy?

Marcus:
No, no, that’s fine. Don’t feel you have to 
come up with a slogan or anything, let’s just get 
some ideas in front of us.

Paul:
Customer care. Customer help. Customer 
service. Oh sorry, we’ve got that one already.

Sally:
How about: ‘Doing things better’?
Maja: Customers doing things better? What do 
you mean?

Sally:
Oh I didn’t know we were only thinking 
about using the word ‘customer’. I was trying to 
think of what it is that we’re actually trying to do.

Maja:
But I think Marcus is looking for something 
more about the customer. 

Marcus:
No, I’m not looking for anything definite 
at this stage. I really want this just to be a 
brainstorm, so anything is fine. We don’t need 
any discussion at this stage about what’s good or 
bad. Let’s just focus on generating ideas. So Sally, 
what exactly did you say?

Sally:
Doing things better.

Marcus:
Doing things better. Good. Anyone else? 

Maja:
In that case, what about, ‘more effectively’, 
‘better service’, ‘more helpful’?

Paul:
‘Getting there together’?

Marcus:
This is good. We’re getting some nice 
ideas now.

Maja:
Do you want something that tells staff what 
they need to do or do you want something that 
reminds them of the goal, Marcus? 

Marcus:
I want something that does both I think. 
Do you want to say something, David? You’ve 
been very quiet so far. Any comments?

David:
Sorry, yes. I was just thinking that perhaps 
we need to think of where we are now and where 
we have to get to. 

Marcus:
Can you elaborate?

David:
I mean at the moment we don’t even offer 
what some of our competitors can offer in terms 
of customer service. We have to equal them.

Paul:
I like that. An equals symbol? Is that a 
useful image?

Anna:
One thing I’ve told my staff is that we have 
to go beyond what customers would normally 
expect. If we only provide what other companies 
do in terms of level of service, then that 
isn’t enough.

Maja:
So more than equals then, in that case. 

Marcus:
This perhaps? 

David:
Plus customers? Customers plus? 
Customers plus one?

Anna:
The Customer Plus Programme?

David:
Very nice.

Marcus:
The Customer Plus Programme. What do 
we think?

Paul:
Yes.

Maja:
I like it.

David:
And it would be a good name if you wanted 
to offer some kind of loyalty programme or 
rewards for coming back to us.

Marcus:
Yeah, I agree. But let’s keep a few more 
ideas coming. We can come back to this one later.
So far we’ve been thinking about this very 
much from our own perspective. Perhaps it 
would be useful to think about it more from the 
customer’s point of view. Now, Sally, you said 
‘doing things better’. Let’s explore that a bit more 
from the customer’s perspective. If you were the 
customer, what would you want us to do better?

Anna:
Speaking as a customer, I’d say I want my 
calls answered more quickly.

Maja:
I want to feel that I matter.

Sally:
Yes, I want to be listened to.

David:
That’s it – I want to feel that they want me 
to explain my problem, not that I’m some sort of 
interruption to their day.

Marcus:
This is great. Let me just note down some 
of these words. We had ‘matter’, ‘listen’, ‘want to 
help’ – it makes me think that the customer IS 
our business. Fantastic, well let’s see where these 
take us ...
