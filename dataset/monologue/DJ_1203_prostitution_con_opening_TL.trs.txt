Daniel:
We should not legalize prostitution and we shouldn't legalize it because prostitution is inherently exploitative and it's also incredibly bad for women in the way that it renders women essentially as tools of male pleasure and thirdly because by legalizing prostitution it's actually going to be more difficult to enforce the enforce against the worst aspects of prostitution because it'll be easier to conceal things like trafficking or underage prostitutes and things like that.
So let's first start by talking about why it's going to be inherently exploitative.
In the same way in that like certain kinds of jobs people don't take unless they're in like financially coercive circumstances, so like it's unlikely that people are going to want to take like more unsavory jobs or like things like that, like people aren't going to want to take like worse off jobs generally because their scene is like less desirable unless they need to for one reason or another or they're in like a more desperate situation.
So I think the problem with this is that it essentially means that like people's sexual autonomy is being stripped away from them and they're essentially , probably because of like financially coercive circumstances, are being forced to surrender their sexual freedom and I think that's pretty messed up because that's like a pretty important thing to most people.
Like your sexual freedom, your sexual identity, and your independence is one of the most important things that you have, and the fact that like it could be stripped away in such that you're forced to employ it just to please men, it is probably not the best thing.
But that brings me into the second reason why we should not legalize prostitution.
And that's that it legitimizes essentially the idea that women can just like pay for like men can just pay for women to sexually gratified them in such a way in which it essentially treats women like tools or like it treats women as if they don't have any kind of like real value or agency on their own and they're just tools that exists for male pleasure and I think that that's probably bad for both like women's rights but also for like normalizing amongst men the way in which women have autonomy, the way in which women have like rights and things like that while you're essentially just normalizing women being seen as like sexual objects for men that for pleasure.
The final thing that I want to talk about though is about how legalizing prostitution will make it harder to enforce against the worst kinds of prostitution and that's because once it becomes legal, it's you're not going to be able to just like arrest everybody, you're not going to be able to be like just investigate against every prostitution organization you may happen to come across, now it's going to become a lot easier for people to like forge documents that they need to to disguise themselves as legal prostitutes, even if they are people who are like traffic or something like that.
So for all of those reasons, do not legalize prostitution.
